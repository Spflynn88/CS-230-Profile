The Game Room was a client looking to develop a platform for thier game 'Draw it or Lose it.'

During my work on the design document I though that I did fairly well overall. Working on the
project did help me to focus on what the course was 'getting at' so to speak. I did not find it
particularly useful during the actual code, but it did help to reinenforce the reading.

It is important to make sure that you understand the clients needs while designing for the same
reason it is in any other job. The ideal outcome is that the client has the product they want and on time. 
Wasting time doing things twice or having an upset client are what happens otherside.

I think the design documents are useful tools, mostly for things like UML diagrams that show how classes
fit together, but i don't see the need for some of it beyond a cetain proint in the process.
